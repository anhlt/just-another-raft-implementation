/**
 * Responsible for propagating (replicating) log entries from this server (the leader)
 * to a follower via the AppendEntries RPC. This is used both for:
 *   1. Replicating new entries when clients submit commands.
 *   2. Sending periodic heartbeats (empty entries) to maintain leadership.
 *
 * Internally, `propagateLogs` will:
 *   1. Fetch the term of the log entry at prevSentIndex, defaulting to 0 if none.
 *   2. Retrieve all log entries from (prevSentIndex + 1) through the end of the local log.
 *   3. Read the current commit index from the `Log` interface.
 *   4. Construct a `LogRequest` payload with:
 *        - leaderId (this node's ID)
 *        - current term
 *        - prevSentLogIndex = prevSentIndex (0-based)
 *        - prevLastLogTerm  = term of that previous entry
 *        - leaderCommit     = current commit index
 *        - entries          = the list of fetched LogEntry objects
 *   5. Send the `LogRequest` to the specified peer and return its `LogRequestResponse`.
 *
 * @tparam F effect type (e.g. IO, Task, etc.)
