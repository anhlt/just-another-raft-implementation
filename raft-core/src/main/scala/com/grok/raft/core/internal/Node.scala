  /** Handles an incoming LogRequest by evaluating the request's term and
    * validating log consistency.
    *
    * When a node receives an AppendEntries (LogRequest) message, the following
    * steps are carried out:
    *
    *   1. Term Update:
    *      - If the term specified in the LogRequest is greater than the node's
    *        current term, the node must update its current term to that of the
    *        incoming request.
    *      - Clear any previously recorded vote (i.e. set votedFor to None) to
    *        ensure no stale state persists.
    *
    * 2. Log Consistency Check:
    *   - Verify that the node's local log is consistent with the leader's log
    *     as indicated by the LogRequest.
    *   - This involves comparing the followerâ€™s log length with the
    *     prevLogIndex provided in the request.
    *   - If the follower's log is sufficiently long, confirm that the term of
    *     the entry at prevLogIndex matches the prevLogTerm in the LogRequest.
    *   - If any inconsistency is detected (e.g., if there is a gap or a term
    *     mismatch), the request should be rejected.
    *
    * @param appendEntriesRequest
    *   the request containing log replication details.
    * @param logState
    *   the current state of the log.
    * @param logEntryAtPrevLogIndex
    *   the log entry at the index specified in the request.
    * @param clusterConfiguration
    *   current cluster configuration details.
    * @return
    *   a tuple comprising the updated Node state and a tuple of
    *   AppendEntriesResponse with any resulting actions.
